A small application for Python 2 and 3 which generates `SWID tags
<http://tagvault.org/swid-tags/>`_ from Linux package managers like dpkg, rpm or
pacman.


Usage
=====

The tool provides 2 subcommands to generate SWID tags or Software IDs.

Generate SWID tags::

    usage: swid_generator swid [-h] [--env {auto,dpkg,pacman,rpm}]
                               [--doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR]
                               [--regid REGID] [--entity-name ENTITY_NAME]
                               [--full] [--pretty] [--hierarchic]
                               [--hash HASH_ALGORITHMS] [--pkcs12 PKCS12]
                               [--pkcs12-pwd PASSWORD]
                               [--software-id SOFTWARE-ID | --package PACKAGE | --package-file FILE_PATH]
                               [--evidence PATH] [--name NAME]
                               [--version-string VERSION] [--new-root PATH]

    Generate SWID tags.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --env {auto,dpkg,pacman,rpm}
                            The package manager environment to be used. Defaults
                            to "auto". If the environment can not be autodetected,
                            the exit code is set to 3.
      --doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR
                            The separator string by which the SWID XML documents
                            are separated. Example: For one newline, use $'\n'.
      --regid REGID         The regid to use in the generated output. May not
                            contain any whitespace characters. Default is
                            "strongswan.org".
      --entity-name ENTITY_NAME
                            The entity name used in the <Entity> XML tag. Default
                            is "strongSwan Project".
      --full                Dump the full SWID tags including directory/file tags
                            for each package.
      --pretty              Indent the XML output.
      --hierarchic          Change directory structure to hierarchic.
      --hash HASH_ALGORITHMS
                            Define the algorithm for the file hashes ("sha256",
                            "sha384", "sha512"). Multiple hashes can be added with
                            comma separated. ("sha256,sha384") Default is "sha256"
      --pkcs12 PKCS12       The pkcs12 container with key and certificate to sign
                            the xml output.
      --pkcs12-pwd PASSWORD
                            If the pkcs12 file is password protected, the password
                            needs to be provided.

    targeted requests:
      You may do a targeted request against either a Software-ID, a package
      name, a package file or a folder structure. The output only contains a
      SWID tag if the argument fully matches the given target. If no matching
      SWID tag is found, the output is empty and the exit code is set to 1.

      --software-id SOFTWARE-ID
                            Do a targeted request for the specified Software-ID. A
                            Software-ID is made up as follows: "{regid}_{unique-
                            id}". Example: "strongswan.org_Ubuntu_12.04-i686-stron
                            gswan-4.5.2-1.2". If no matching package is found, the
                            output is empty and the exit code is set to 1.
      --package PACKAGE     Do a targeted request for the specified package name.
                            The package name corresponds to a package name
                            returned by the environment's package manager, e.g
                            "glibc-headers" on a dpkg managed environment. If no
                            matching package is found, the output is empty and the
                            exit code is set to 1.
      --package-file FILE_PATH
                            Create SWID-Tag based on information of a Package-
                            File. Rpm-Environment: *.rpm File, Dpkg-Environment:
                            *.deb File, Pacman-Environment: *.pgk.tar.xz File
      --evidence PATH       Create a SWID Tag from a directory on the filesystem.
                            This changes the payload element to a evidence
                            element.
      --name NAME           Specify a name for an directory based SWID-Tag.
                            Default is "{evidence-path}_{os-string}"
      --version-string VERSION
                            Specify the version for an directory based SWID-Tag.
                            Default is "1.0.0"
      --new-root PATH       Change the displayed "root"-folder from the provided
                            directory to an other path.



Generate Software IDs::

    usage: swid_generator software-id [-h] [--env {auto,dpkg,pacman,rpm}]
                                      [--doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR]
                                      [--regid REGID]

    Generate Software-IDs.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --env {auto,dpkg,pacman,rpm}
                            The package manager environment to be used. Defaults
                            to "auto". If the environment can not be autodetected,
                            the exit code is set to 3.
      --doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR
                            The separator string by which the SWID XML documents
                            are separated. Example: For one newline, use $'\n'.
      --regid REGID         The regid to use in the generated output. May not
                            contain any whitespace characters. Default is
                            "strongswan.org".


Possible Return Codes
---------------------

If the application fails somehow, an exit code is set appropriately:

- 1: A targeted request did not return any results.
- 2: Invalid arguments passed.
- 3: Either the given environment is not installed or the environment  
  could not be autodetected.
- 4: An internal error has occured.
- 5: An external command has thrown an error.

The exit code can be shown with::

    $ echo $?


Reserved Characters
-------------------

URI reserved characters (``:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=``) in the package name / version
section of the Unique-ID are replaced with a tilde (``~``) sign.


Installation
============

The following package managers are supported:

- dpkg (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ...)
- pacman (Arch Linux, Manjaro, ...)
- rpm (Fedora, Red Hat, OpenSUSE, ...)

The following Python versions are fully supported:

- Python 2.7
- Python 3.3
- Python 3.4
- Python 3.5
- Python 3.6
- PyPy

Important: Python 2.6 no longer supported.

Requirements
------------
To take advantage of the generator's whole functionality, following packages must be installed before usage:

For the function --package-file (Generate SWID-Tag based on Package-File information):

- Debian: tar, ar
- Redhat: rpm2cpio, cpio
- Archlinux: tar

For the function --pkcs12 (Sign SWID-Tag):

- Debian, Redhat and Archlinux: xmlsec1

Install with pip
----------------

The recommended way to install swidGenerator is using `pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_:

::

    $ sudo pip install -U swid_generator

This will automatically install the latest version from the `Python Package
Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/swid_generator/>`__.

Manual Installation
-------------------

Get code::

    $ wget https://github.com/strongswan/swidGenerator/archive/v0.3.0.zip
    $ unzip v0.3.0.zip
    $ cd swidGenerator-0.3.0

Install::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

Development Installation
------------------------

To make invocation easier during development, use pip's editable installation
feature instead, which means that changes in the code are immediately
reflected::

    $ pip install -e .

Invoke application 
------------------

If you have installed the application, you can run the generator via the
``swid_generator`` binary::

    $ swid_generator

You can also invoke the generator directly from the source directory, without
any prior installation::

    $ python -m swid_generator.main


Testing
=======

**Setup**

Testing for swidGenerator is set up using `Tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/>`_
and `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_. Violations of the coding guidelines (PEP8
with a few small tweaks) are counted as test fails.

The only requirement to run the tests is tox::

    $ pip install tox

**Running tests**

To test only a single Python version, use the ``-e`` parameter::

    $ tox -e py27

To see the coverage, use the ``cov`` testenv (which uses Python 2.7 by
default)::

    $ tox -e cov

You can also combine multiple testenvs, just make sure that you have the
corresponding Python versions installed::

    $ tox -e py27,py34,cov

**Integration testing**

The support on each distribution-base (Debian, Redhat and Archlinux) is guaranteed by the integration tests, which runs in docker containers.
The Dockerfiles for these containers are hosted on `Dockerhub <http://hub.docker.com/>`_ and are pulled directly from the Travis-CI Build-server.
These tests are started by the `integration_test_runner.py` script as follows::

    python integration_test_runner.py <path_to_sourcecode_folder> <specific_python_version> <list_of_environments>;

- <path_to_sourcecode_folder>:    Actual SourceCode folder (e.g: `echo ${PWD}`, Format: /path/to/sourcecode/)
- <specific_python_version>:      Specific Python version (e.g: $TOXENV, Format: py27, py33, py36, etc.)
- <list_of_environments>:         List of the environments. (e.g: dpkg pacman rpm)

Usage of the docker containers are described on `Dockerhub-Repository <https://hub.docker.com/r/davidedegiorgio/swidgenerator-dockerimages/>`_

**CI**

We use different continuous integration / quality assurance services:

- Travis CI (testing): https://travis-ci.org/strongswan/swidGenerator
- Coveralls (test coverage): https://coveralls.io/r/strongswan/swidGenerator
- Landscape (code quality): https://landscape.io/github/strongswan/swidGenerator/


Coding Guidelines
=================

Use PEP8 with ``--max-line-length=149`` and the following error codes ignored:
``E126 E127 E128``.


Packaging
=========

Upload to PyPI
--------------

To upload a new version to PyPI, configure your ``.pypirc`` and execute the
following commands::

    $ pip install wheel
    $ python setup.py register
    $ python setup.py sdist upload
    $ python setup.py bdist_wheel upload


Building .deb Package
---------------------

You can create an unsigned .deb package using the ``package.sh`` script::

    $ ./package.sh
    ...
    $ ls dist/
    swid-generator_0.1.1-1_all.deb

Note that this only works on a debian based system. Take a look at the comments
in the script for more information.

Building the Manpage
--------------------

You can build a manpage using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_::

    $ cd docs
    $ make man
    $ man ./_build/man/swid_generator.1
