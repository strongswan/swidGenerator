Application which generates SWID-Tags from Linux installed packages, using tools as dpkg and rpm.

Usage
=====
The tool provides 2 subcommands to generate SWID tags or Software IDs

Generate SWID tags:
::

    usage: main.py swid [-h] [--doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR] [--regid REGID]
                        [--environment {dpkg,rpm,auto}] [--full] [--pretty]
                        [--entity-name ENTITY_NAME]

    Generate SWID tags

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR
                            Specify a separator string by which the SWID XML
                            documents are separated. e.g for 1 newline use $'\n'
      --regid REGID         Specify the regid value (used in the <Entity> tag for
                            the regid attribute).Shall not contain any whitespace
                            characters
      --environment {dpkg,rpm,auto}
                            Specify the environment to be used. Defaults to
                            auto. If the environment can not be autodetected the
                            exit code is set to 3.
      --full                Dumps the full SWID tags including file tags for each
                            package
      --pretty              Generate pretty readable output
      --entity-name ENTITY_NAME
                            Specify the entity name (used in the <Entity> tag for
                            the name attribute).Shall not contain any whitespace
                            characters
      --match SOFTWARE-ID   Do a targeted request for the specified Software-ID.
                            If specified, output only contains SWID tags matching
                            the given Software-ID. If no matching package is
                            found, the output is empty and the exit code is set to
                            1.

Generate Software IDs:
::

    usage: main.py software-id [-h] [--doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR]
                               [--regid REGID] [--environment {dpkg,rpm,auto}]

    Generate Software IDs

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR
                            Specify a separator string by which the SWID XML
                            documents are separated. e.g for 1 newline use $'\n'
      --regid REGID         Specify the regid value (used in the <Entity> tag for
                            the regid attribute).Shall not contain any whitespace
                            characters
      --environment {dpkg,rpm,auto}
                            Specify the environment to be used. Defaults to
                            auto. If the environment can not be autodetected the
                            exit code is set to 3.

Possible Return Codes
---------------------

| If the application fails somehow, an exit code is set appropriately:
| **Exit Code 1**: A targeted request did not return any results.
| **Exit Code 2**: Invalid arguments passed.
| **Exit Code 3**: Either the given environment is not installed or the environment  
                   could not be autodetected.
                   
The exit code can be shown with::

    $ echo $?
    

Installation
============

The swidGenerator currently supports dpkg and rpm managed environments. 
It depends on the command line utilities dpkg-query and rpm for querying the package managers.
The follwing Linux distributions have been tested so far

- Fedora 19 i686
- Ubuntu 12.04 i686
- OpenSuse 12.3 i686

Get Code
--------

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/tnc-ba/swidGenerator
    
Install
-------

To copy the files to your system-wide Python directory, use

::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

To make invocation easier during development, use pip's editable installation
feature instead, which means that changes in the code are immediately
reflected::

    $ pip install -e .

Invoke application 
------------------

If you have installed the application, you can run the generator via the
``swid_generator`` binary::

    $ swid_generator

You can also invoke the generator directly from the source directory, without
any prior installation::

    $ python -m swid_generator.main
