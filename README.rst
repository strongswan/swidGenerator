A small application for Python 2 and 3 which generates SWID-Tags from Linux
installed packages, using tools like dpkg and rpm.


Usage
=====
The tool provides 2 subcommands to generate SWID tags or Software IDs

Generate SWID tags:
::

    usage: swid_generator swid [-h] [--env {auto,rpm,dpkg}]
                               [--doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR] [--regid REGID]
                               [--entity-name ENTITY_NAME] [--full] [--pretty]
                               [--software-id SOFTWARE-ID | --package PACKAGE]

    Generate SWID tags.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
      --env {auto,rpm,dpkg}
                            The package manager environment to be used. Defaults to "auto".
                            If the environment can not be autodetected, the exit code is set
                            to 3.
      --doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR
                            The separator string by which the SWID XML documents are
                            separated. Example: For one newline, use $'\n'.
      --regid REGID         The regid to use in the generated output. May not contain any
                            whitespace characters. Default is
                            "regid.2004-03.org.strongswan".
      --entity-name ENTITY_NAME
                            The entity name used in the <Entity> XML tag. May not contain
                            any whitespace characters. Default is "strongSwan".
      --full                Dump the full SWID tags including file tags for each package.
      --pretty              Indent the XML output.

    targeted requests:
      You may do a targeted request against either a Software-ID or a package name. The
      output only contains a SWID tag if the argument fully matches the given target. If
      no matching SWID tag is found, the output is empty and the exit code is set to 1.

      --software-id SOFTWARE-ID
                            Do a targeted request for the specified Software-ID. A Software-
                            ID is made up as follows: "{regid}_{unique-id}". Example: "regid
                            .2004-03.org.strongswan_Ubuntu_12.04-i686-strongswan-4.5.2-1.2".
                            If no matching package is found, the output is empty and the
                            exit code is set to 1.
      --package PACKAGE     Do a targeted request for the specified package name. The
                            package name corresponds to a package name returned by the
                            environment's package manager, e.g "glibc-headers" on a dpkg
                            managed environment. If no matching package is found, the output
                            is empty and the exit code is set to 1.

Generate Software IDs:
::

    usage: swid_generator software-id [-h] [--env {auto,rpm,dpkg}]
                                      [--doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR] [--regid REGID]

    Generate Software-IDs.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
      --env {auto,rpm,dpkg}
                            The package manager environment to be used. Defaults to "auto".
                            If the environment can not be autodetected, the exit code is set
                            to 3.
      --doc-separator DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR
                            The separator string by which the SWID XML documents are
                            separated. Example: For one newline, use $'\n'.
      --regid REGID         The regid to use in the generated output. May not contain any
                            whitespace characters. Default is
                            "regid.2004-03.org.strongswan".


Possible Return Codes
---------------------

If the application fails somehow, an exit code is set appropriately:

- 1: A targeted request did not return any results.
- 2: Invalid arguments passed.
- 3: Either the given environment is not installed or the environment  
  could not be autodetected.
                   
The exit code can be shown with::

    $ echo $?
    

Installation
============

The swidGenerator currently supports dpkg and rpm managed environments. It
depends on the command line utilities ``dpkg-query`` and ``rpm`` for querying
the package managers. The follwing Linux distributions have been tested so far:

- Fedora 19 i686
- Ubuntu 12.04 i686
- OpenSuse 12.3 i686

The following Python versions are supported:

- Python 2.7
- Python 3.3+
- PyPy

Install with pip
----------------

The recommended way to install swidGenerator is using `pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_:

::

    $ sudo pip install -U swid_generator

This will automatically install the latest version from the `Python Package
Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/swid_generator/>`__.

Manual Installation
-------------------

Get code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/tnc-ba/swidGenerator

Install::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

Development Installation
------------------------

To make invocation easier during development, use pip's editable installation
feature instead, which means that changes in the code are immediately
reflected::

    $ pip install -e .

Invoke application 
------------------

If you have installed the application, you can run the generator via the
``swid_generator`` binary::

    $ swid_generator

You can also invoke the generator directly from the source directory, without
any prior installation::

    $ python -m swid_generator.main


Testing
=======

**Setup**

Testing for swidGenerator is set up using `Tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/>`_
and `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_. Violations of the coding guidelines (PEP8
with a few small tweaks) are counted as test fails.

The only requirement to run the tests is tox::

    $ pip install tox

**Running tests**

To test only a single Python version, use the ``-e`` parameter::

    $ tox -e py27

To see the coverage, use the ``cov`` testenv (which uses Python 2.7 by
default)::

    $ tox -e cov

You can also combine multiple testenvs, just make sure that you have the
corresponding Python versions installed::

    $ tox -e py27,py34,cov

**CI**

We use different continuous integration / quality assurance services:

- Travis CI (testing): https://travis-ci.org/tnc-ba/swidGenerator
- Coveralls (test coverage): https://coveralls.io/r/tnc-ba/swidGenerator
- Landscape (code quality): https://landscape.io/github/tnc-ba/swidGenerator/


Coding Guidelines
=================

Use PEP8 with ``--max-line-length=109`` and the following error codes ignored:
``E126 E127 E128``.
